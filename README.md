<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- you can see my demo at: https://f0sternest.github.io/errorpage.com/
- My experience making this up was great, i just get exited when i have something to code, doesn't matter how simple it may be.
- I have learned that i actually know how to use media queries (this was my firts time using it in a project). But i would love some feedback on best practices: making my code more easy to read and the best methods to achive the same result that i got.
- i've only been with web development for less than a year, so im pretty happy with what can i do.
